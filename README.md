PREDICTING CHURN RATE OF CUSTOMERS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY (A CASE STUDY OF ETISALAT NIGERIA)
The project is to determine the customer churn rate in Etisalat Nigeria.
So, in a nutshell, I made use of a customer churn dataset from Kaggle to build a machine learning classifier that predicts the propensity of any customer to churn in months to come with a reasonable accuracy score of 76% to 84%.
